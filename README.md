# Mamba-based Encoder for Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) Prediction

> A novel framework for accurately identifying phase-separated proteins, leveraging contrastive learning and experimental condition integration.

---

## **Overview**

Liquidâ€“liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a critical mechanism in cellular processes, such as protein aggregation and RNA metabolism, by forming membraneless subcellular structures. Accurate identification of phase-separated proteins is essential for advancing our understanding and control of these processes. However, traditional methods are costly and time-intensive, while existing machine learning approaches are often constrained by experimental conditions.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a **Mamba-based Encoder** using **contrastive learning**, incorporating:
- **Separation probability**
- **Protein type**
- **Experimental conditions**

Our model demonstrated outstanding performance:
- **97.1% accuracy** in predicting phase-separated proteins.
- **ROCAUC score of 0.87** in classifying scaffold and client proteins.

Further validation in the **DGHBP-2 drug delivery system** highlighted its potential for condition modulation in drug development.
